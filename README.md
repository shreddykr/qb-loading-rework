## 🧠 Quick Setup Guide

### 1️⃣ Grab the New Look
Download the latest version of **qb-loading** and replace the old `html` folder with the new one.

### 2️⃣ Pick Your Slideshow
Download my photos from the link below — or go wild and make your own!  
You can use up to **8 images** (if you use fewer... who knows what’ll happen. Probably nothing. Probably chaos. Either way, I’m not losing sleep over it😅).

### 3️⃣ Customize the Sound
I went with a subtle **wind noise** for that cinematic touch.  
If you’d rather change it, jump into:

📂 **Folder Reference**
- Images → `qb-loading-assets-images`
- Audio  → `qb-loading-assets-audio`
